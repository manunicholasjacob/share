-- write a program in python to be implemented in linus on pci expresss

-- use setpci and lspci to help do this 

-- create a master bdf list

-- search by vendor number

-- iterate through list of bdfs for vendor number - the vendor number of gpu is 10de

-- create a list of bdfs which are only for gpus - gpu list

-- create a list of bdfs for all those bdfs which have header number where the first bit is one (eg 01) - bdf list

-- take each gpu bdf and take the first 2 numbers eg: 17:00.0 becomes 17 

--  go through the bdf list and find the specific bdf whose secondary bus number is the same as the first 2 numbers of the gpu bdf this is the first upstream post 

-- dow take the first 2 digits of the first upstream port and find the 2nd upstream port and for the same till there are no upstream ports

-- do this for all the gpu bdfs in the gpu list

-- Ouput using print statements a set of lists (one for each element of the gpu list) and the upstream list
